This repository contains the research paper and associated resources for "Deep Learning-Based Face Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis with Real-Time Application", authored by Rudra Akhauri. The project presents a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in face recognition tasks, highlighting their superiority over traditional methods such as Eigenfaces.

The paper includes a literature review of conventional and modern face recognition techniques, detailed methodology using CNN architecture trained on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. It also features a real-time prototype application developed using OpenCV that demonstrates the practical deployment of the trained model in dynamic environments with varying lighting and latency conditions.

This repository is useful for researchers, students, and developers interested in deep learning, computer vision, biometrics, and real-time application development.
